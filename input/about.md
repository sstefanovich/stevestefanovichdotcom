Title: About Me
---
Hi, I'm Steve Stefanovich, a Principal Architect at [RDA Corporation](https://www.rdacorp.com) which I've happily called home since 1998. In that time I've worked with everything from VB6 to React, SQL Server to Azure Storage, Fast Search to ElasticSearch, and much more. I watched SharePoint grow up and move to the cloud and SilverLight whiz by as it left our browsers for good. Countless talented people have crossed my path and helped my professional development in ways I can't begin to describe. I have participated in more projects than I can remember and done everything from full stack development to multi-terabyte SharePoint migrations. I love a new challenge almost as much as a new technology. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/) in 1995 and have a long list of Microsoft certifications in everything from Office 365 to Designing and Developing Azure Application. I'm excited about .NET Core, Azure, Office 365, Service Fabric, and the rapid pace of change!
